# Fingerprintless

Don't want to use fingerprinted filenames when you use `<%= image_tag %>` on your rails website in production mode? Fingerprintless allows you to remove the fingerprint from an url generated by `<%= image_tag %>` in the Rails asset pipeline. This can be extremely helpful for SEO purposes or when you write a newsletter that needs a static link.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'fingerprintless'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

To disable fingerprinting for a specific image in your view, use:

    <%= image_tag "foobar.png", :fingerprinting => false %>
    
Now `<img src="/assets/foobar-c9c1735bd1858a6c3163a46059408bc2.png">` becomes `<img src="/assets/foobar.png">`.
